A* shortest path algorithm. Implemented with a min heap. Using a min heap is 
faster than using a priority queue given the sparse nature of OpenStreetMap 
data, i.e. vertices far outnumber edges.

There are two implementations:
- `AStarVector` is faster for small graphs and/or long paths. This is default. 
    It pre-allocates vectors at the start of the algorithm to store 
    distances, parents and visited nodes. This speeds up graph traversal at the 
    cost of large memory usage.
- `AStarDict` is faster for large graphs and/or short paths.
    It dynamically allocates memory during traversal to store distances, 
    parents and visited nodes. This is faster compared to `AStarVector` when 
    the graph contains a large number of nodes and/or not much traversal is 
    required.

Compared to `jl`, this version improves runtime, memory usage, has a flexible 
heuristic function, and accounts for OpenStreetMap turn restrictions through 
the `cost_adjustment` function.

**Note**: A heuristic that does not accurately estimate the remaining cost to 
`goal` (i.e. overestimating heuristic) will result in a non-optimal path 
(i.e. not the shortest), dijkstra on the other hand guarantees the optimal path 
as the heuristic cost is zero.

# Arguments
- `::Type{<:AStar}`: Implementation to use, either `AStarVector` (default) or 
    `AStarDict`.
- `g::AbstractGraph{U}`: Graphs abstract graph object.
- `weights::AbstractMatrix{T}`: Edge weights matrix.
- `src::W`: Source vertex.
- `goal::W`: Goal vertex.
- `heuristic::Function=h(u, v) =  0.0`: Heuristic cost function, takes a source 
    and target vertex, default is 0.
- `cost_adjustment:::Function=r(u, v, parents) = 0.0`: Optional cost adjustment 
    function for use cases such as turn restrictions, takes a source and target 
    vertex, defaults to 0.
- `max_distance::T=typemax(T)`: Maximum weight to traverse the graph, returns 
    `nothing` if this is reached.

# Return
- `Union{Nothing,Vector{U}}`: Array veritces represeting shortest path from 
    `src` to `goal`.
